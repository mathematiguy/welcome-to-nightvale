## Here is some example text

I just received word that Mayor Cardinal has resigned. She is stepping down as Director of Emergency Press Conferences. Well, let me tell you a story. 
Mayor Cardinal issued this statement:

>I will not be a bystander, nor a leader, for the good of the city.\
>I will be the face of Night Vale, and not a faceless old woman who secretly lives in your home or in your home's bathroom. \
>And I will protect you against a crime that requires my presence. \
>Yes, I know that I have been approached several times by angry and capricious Night Vale citizens who have grown so used to my presence that they have no choice but to flee. I know that I have helped them out of their troubles, and have done so without fear of retribution, without pity or even benevolence. But I am not a savior, not a savior for the good of our town.

Mayor Cardinal said this in a statement. And now let me tell you the story of how I saved my town from crime.

Before we began, the robber who entered our studio thought he was a Night Vale resident, but the burglar inside was actually a transient named Lee Marvin, whom I had just saved from being burned out by the neighboring town of Red Mesa. Carlos and I stayed up late to watch the sunrise, and I told him we had caught the robbery, because I knew I had saved Carlos. And Lee said: "You have a good partner, but one that can't win back your heart."
